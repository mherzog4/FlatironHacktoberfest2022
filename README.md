# Flatiron Hacktoberfest 2022

A beginner friendly way to learn how to contribute to an open source project and get credit for Hacktoberfest 2022

## üòéGetting Started with Hacktoberfest
Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source, organized by Digital Ocean.

If you've never made a pull request before, or participated in an open-source project, I recommend taking a look at:

DigitalOcean: [INTRODUCTION TO GITHUB AND OPEN-SOURCE PROJECTS](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/an-introduction-to-open-source)

GitHub: [HOW TO CONTRIBUTE TO OPEN SOURCE](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)

## üëÄRules

[Register](https://hacktoberfest.com/) anytime between September 26 and October 31

Pull requests can be made in any Github or Gitlab hosted project that‚Äôs participating in Hacktoberfest (look for the ‚Äúhacktoberfest‚Äù topic)

Project maintainers must accept your pull/merge requests for them to count toward your total

Have 4 pull/merge requests accepted between October 1 and October 31 to complete Hacktoberfest

The first 40,000 participants (maintainers and contributors) who complete Hacktoberfest can elect to receive one of two prizes: a tree planted in their name, or the Hacktoberfest 2022 t-shirt.

## üöÄHow to contribute

1. First up you need to fork (make a copy) of this repo to your Github account.

2. Clone (download) your fork to your computer

3. Set your streams so you can sync your clone with the original repo (get the latest updates)

   - `git remote add upstream https://github.com/mherzog4/FlatironHacktoberfest2022.git`
   - `git pull upstream master`
   - The above 2 commands will synchronize your forked version of the project with the actual repository.

4.  Create a new branch for your modifications (ie. `git branch new-user` and check it out `git checkout new-user` or simply do `git checkout -b new-user`)


5. Pull from the upstream again, like we did in step 3. This is to ensure we still have the latest code.

    - `git pull upstream master`

6. Commit and push the code to your fork

7. Create a pull request to have the changes merged from your fork into the origin


## Congratulations!ü•≥üéâüëè

You are now one pull request closer to getting that free t-shirt. 

Repeat these steps until you have made at least 4 qualifying pull requests.

Have Fun and Happy Coding!
