❇️ Rules




❇️ How to contribute

First up you need to fork (make a copy) of this repo to your Github account.

Clone (download) your fork to your computer

Set your streams so you can sync your clone with the original repo (get the latest updates)

git remote add upstream https://github.com/mherzog4/FlatironHacktoberfest2022
git pull upstream master
The above 2 commands will synchronize your forked version of the project with the actual repository.
Create a branch

In the src directory (folder), create a directory named after yourself.

Within this folder you just made, create four files, an HTML file, a CSS file, and a JS file.

Pull from the upstream again, like we did in step 3. This is to ensure we still have the latest code.

git pull upstream master
Commit and push the code to your fork

Create a pull request to have the changes merged from your fork into the origin

Tweet about making your first Hacktoberfest pull request!

Congratulations! You are now one pull request closer to getting that free t-shirt. Repeat these steps until you have made at least 4 qualifying pull requests. You can check how many qualifying pull requests you have made at https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/profile Have Fun and Happy Coding!
